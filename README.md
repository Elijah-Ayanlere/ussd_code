# USSD Data Plan System

This Python script simulates a USSD-based data plan system for a mobile network provider (e.g., MTN). Users can navigate through options to purchase data plans, check balances, and exit the system.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**
   - Run the script using a Python interpreter:
     ```bash
     python ussd_data_plan.py
     ```
2. **Enter USSD Code:**
   - Upon running the script, you will be prompted to enter a USSD code.
   - Enter "*312#" to proceed with the data plan system.

3. **Navigate Through Options:**
   - Once the USSD code is entered correctly, you can navigate through the following options:
     - Data Plans
     - Social Bundles
     - Balance Check
     - Exit

4. **Data Plan Options:**
   - Choose data plans based on daily, weekly, or monthly durations.
   - Further select specific plans and receive a confirmation message.

5. **Social Bundle Options:**
   - Select social bundles for WhatsApp, Facebook, or Instagram.
   - Choose from various plans and receive confirmation messages.

6. **Balance Check:**
   - Check your total balance with a dedicated option.

7. **Exit:**
   - Choose the exit option to end the USSD session.

## Note

- This script is a basic simulation and does not interact with a real mobile network.
- Adapt and customize the script for more complex USSD applications or integrate it with actual network functionalities.
- The USSD code "*312#" is used as a sample code; you may adjust it based on your requirements.
- For any questions or issues, feel free to customize the code or seek assistance from the Python community.
